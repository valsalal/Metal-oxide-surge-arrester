# Metal-oxide-surge-arrester
Stray capacitive effect of Metal Oxide Surge Arrester (MOSA) may cause non-uniform voltage distribution in both non-conduction and conduction modes. Also, during conduction, there is a delay in operation of arrester, particularly when faced with very fast transient overvoltages (VFTOs). Consequently, there is a necessity to reduce stray capacitive effect for improvement in voltage distribution and reduce delay in response of arrester for VFTOs. One approach is placement of grading rings with appropriate number and size. Numerous researchers have conducted extensive studies on causes of non-uniform voltage distribution, computation of stray capacitances and remedial measures to achieve a more uniform voltage distribution. Further, this investigation holds great significance in polluted environments, damaged arresters and broken sheds, as proper operation of surge arresters relies on environmental conditions, material properties, and shapes of arrester assembly. This paper provides a summary of research conducted by various researchers from the year 1970 and also offers suggestions for further studies of achieving a more uniform voltage distribution and reducing response delay of MOSAs.
